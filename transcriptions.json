You can't just throw spices in a pot and expect magic. Same goes for leadin' men. You gotta know what you're workin' with. Rowan. A blade ain't worth a damn if the one holdin' it don't know patience. Same with a cookin' a knife. Too eager, and you'll lose a finger. The world's a kitchen lad. Hot, messy, and full of people who don't know what they're doin'. Your job? Keep your fire steady. Ah, now that's a stew. Fit for a king. Literally.",
